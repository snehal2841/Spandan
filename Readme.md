# Spandan- Multispeciality Hospital website

## HINT Hacka-demic - Going Contactless

A Hospital involves hundreds of work, which is currently carried out physically. Evolving Tech has always proven that, how its efficient in making the things work Contact-less, and even with less hassle. We have come up with a idea of making the things in Hospiatl go contact-less.

Spandan is a Hospital which has a website(which is mobile responsive, so as mobile users can too use it easily), and it will make a lot of things contact less as follows and in following workflow Diagram-

- A visitor on the site can get many details quicky for the side bar such as Quick Links, Covid Details and
  Blood Bank's data of availibitly of all bllod group bags. Visitor can know all the details like emergency contacts, Hospital timings, Departments and Board of Doctors in it.

- In contrast to traditional appointment which is by personally visiting the hospital, and then there recietient
  enter your details and makes a card for you, one can register  
  themseleves on this site, and book a appointment at availiable time, slot

- A patient's medical profile is a place where the doctor will add typed prescription notes, which can be printed/
  downloaded. Patient's profile will also contain(uploaded) his/her past medical reports and checkup prescriptions, in Spandan Hospital. This will help both patient and doctor, patient can lookup for any prscription or reports he had in past whereas a doctor while reviweing his medical reports can lookup for all his past medical history.

- A prescription will not be written by doctor, rather he will open respective patient's profile and add a  
  prescription in a form, typed one. So, that patient too can understand it, and will stay with him always on the account.

### How it makes CONTACT-LESS?

- A patient doesn't need to stand in queue for registering in hospital and for getting a Hospital card, it can be
  done by registering at Spandan website and get the card downloaded in pdf

- A prescription note will not be written rather will be typed by doctor on patient's profile, and a copy of it
  would be printed for patient. The patient will also bear its pdf, and can get medicines from pharamacy, by just sharing it.

- In some patient's cases(which needs study of previous reports/scans/prescriptions), a doctor won't have to  
  handle all the reports and prescriptions; all of them will be available at one place, on the patients profile.

- No need to call to the hospiatl to know for vacancies for Corona affect patient, one can look up on the  
  website's Side bar all these details.
- And many other features of this application will help in going contact-less and secure medical process in a  
  hospital.
